Python offers powerful functionality for working with files, allowing you to read and write data efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

1. Opening Files:

Use the open() function with the filename and desired mode:
open("filename.txt", "r"): Opens for reading (default).
open("filename.txt", "w"): Opens for writing (existing content will be overwritten).
open("filename.txt", "a"): Opens for appending (adds content to the end).
Other modes available for reading and writing binary data ("rb", "wb").

2. Reading Files:

Use methods on the opened file object:
read(): Reads the entire file as a string.
readline(): Reads one line of the file as a string.
readlines(): Reads all lines of the file as a list of strings.
For loop iteration: for line in file: iterates through each line.

3. Writing Files:

Use methods on the opened file object:
write(data): Writes the given string to the file.
writelines(list_of_strings): Writes a list of strings to the file (one per line).
String formatting techniques like f-strings can be used for writing complex data.

4. Closing Files:

Important: Ensure proper resource management by closing the file:
Use the close() method on the file object.
Python uses context managers (with open(...)) to automatically close files.

5. Error Handling:

Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors like file not found or access denied.'''
