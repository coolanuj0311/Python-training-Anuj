'''Decorators:

Functions that modify the behavior of other functions.
Remember:

Decorators provide a powerful way to modify function behavior without altering their code directly.
Use them to enhance code readability, maintainability, and add cross-cutting concerns.
Explore libraries like functools for additional decorator utilities.
