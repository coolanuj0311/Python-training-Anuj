'''Operators:

Symbols for performing operations on values (e.g., +, -, *, /, ==, !=).


Arithmetic Operators:

+ (Addition): Adds two values. Example: 5 + 3 = 8
- (Subtraction): Subtracts one value from another. Example: 10 - 4 = 6
* (Multiplication): Multiplies two values. Example: 2 * 7 = 14
/ (Division): Divides one value by another. Example: 15 / 3 = 5.0 (returns a float)
// (Floor Division): Divides and discards the remainder (returns an integer). Example: 17 // 4 = 4
% (Modulo): Returns the remainder of a division. Example: 9 % 4 = 1
** (Exponentiation): Raises a value to a power. Example: 2 ** 3 = 8

Comparison Operators:

== (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal. Example: 5 == 5 is True
!= (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal. Example: 7 != 3 is True
> (Greater than): Checks if one value is greater than another. Example: 12 > 8 is True
< (Less than): Checks if one value is less than another. Example: 4 < 9 is True
>= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another. Example: 10 >= 10 is True
<= (Less than or equal to): Checks if one value is less than or equal to another. Example: 6 <= 7 is True

Logical Operators:

and: Returns True if both operands are True. Example: (5 > 2) and (3 < 8) is True
or: Returns True if at least one operand is True. Example: (10 == 9) or (4 != 4) is False
not: Inverts the truth value of an operand. Example: not (7 == 7) is False

Assignment Operators:

=: Assigns a value to a variable. Example: x = 10
+=: Adds and assigns. Example: x += 5 is equivalent to x = x + 5
-=: Subtracts and assigns. Example: y -= 3 is equivalent to y = y - 3
*=: Multiplies and assigns. Example: z *= 2 is equivalent to z = z * 2
/=: Divides and assigns. Example: a /= 4 is equivalent to a = a / 4
//=: Floor divides and assigns. Example: b //= 2 is equivalent to b = b // 2
%=: Calculates modulo and assigns. Example: c %= 7 is equivalent to c = c % 7
**=: Raises to a power and assigns. Example: d **= 3 is equivalent to d = d ** 3
Bitwise Operators:

& (Bitwise AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation on binary values.
| (Bitwise OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation on binary values.
^ (Bitwise XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR operation on binary values.
~ (Bitwise NOT): Inverts the bits of a binary value.
<< (Left shift): Shifts bits to the left.
>> (Right shift): Shifts bits to the right.

Membership Operators:

in: Checks if a value is present in a sequence (like a list or string). Example: 3 in [1, 2, 3] is True
not in: Checks if a value is not present in a sequence. Example: "apple" not in ["banana", "orange"] is True

Identity Operators:

is: Checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory. Example: x = 5; y = 5; x is y is True
is not: Checks if two variables do not refer to the same object. Example: `x = [
